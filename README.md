## Algorithms

- K-means Clustering: Partition-based clustering algorithm
- DBSCAN: Density-based clustering algorithm
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Linear dimensionality reduction
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Non-linear dimensionality reduction

## Interactive Visualizations

Each algorithm has an interactive visualization that allows you to:

- Adjust parameters and observe the effects in real-time
- Step through the algorithm execution
- Add points manually
- Zoom and pan to explore the data

## Learning Resources

Each algorithm page includes learning resources such as:

- Algorithm guides
- Implementation details
- Real-world use cases
- Links to external resources
